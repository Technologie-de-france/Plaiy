Letâ€™s make machine learning easy with scikit-learn on LaVIEW.

TDF teams is proud to propose for free the Scikit-learn library adapted for LabVIEW on open source.
It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy from the famous Scikit-learn python library. 

## Installation

The library works with Labview 2020 and python 3.6. 

The gold of the download of the library, python as well as the modules used are installed.However, if an error occurs, check that the modules "scikit-learn", "scipy", "numpy", "pillow" and "sys" are installed. To do this, enter the command "pip list" in the command prompt. 
If one or more modules are not installed enter the command "pip install module_name" in the command prompt (windows + cmd enter).
